      <h1>My approach focuses on improving what already exists, not reinventing everything from scratch.</h1>
      <p class="hero-text">
        I take real courses, real LMS shells, and real constraints, then upgrade them so learners know
        exactly what to do next and instructors can teach without fighting the tools.

    <!-- Core principles -->
    <section class="pillars">
      <h2>Three principles that guide my work</h2>
      <div class="pillar-grid">
        <article class="pillar">
          <h3>Reduce cognitive load</h3>
          <p>
            I identify unnecessary thinking work that gets in the way of learning:
            scattered links, dense text blocks, unclear labels, and extra clicks.
            The goal is to keep cognitive resources on the content, not the interface.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="pillar">
          <h3>Design for flow and scannability</h3>
          <p>
            I organize each lesson into a small sequence of clearly labelled steps.
            Headings, chunking, and visual hierarchy make it easy to see the path,
            so learners can scan, orient themselves quickly, and stay on track.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="pillar">
          <h3>Scale through patterns and templates</h3>
          <p>
            I design model lessons, templates, and quick reference guides that
            other instructors can adopt with minimal friction. One solid pattern
            can quietly improve a whole program or department.

    <!-- SCD-style process -->
    <section class="highlight">
      <div class="highlight-content">
        <h2>How I work with a course or project</h2>
        <p>
          My student-centred design process is practical and grounded in real courses.
          It balances learner needs, faculty preferences, and institutional standards.
        </p>

        <ol class="process-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Clarify the purpose and constraints.</strong>
            I start with outcomes, audience, and realities such as time, tools,
            and instructor workload. This shapes how far we can go in the first pass.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Map the learning flow.</strong>
            I sketch a simple sequence of what learners see and do:
            orienting information, learning tasks, checks for understanding,
            and key handoffs between weeks or modules.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reshape content into learner-friendly chunks.</strong>
            Dense documents become concise overviews plus smaller components.
            I highlight key ideas, remove repetition, and align activities with outcomes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Build the course shell and micro guidance.</strong>
            I set up the LMS structure, naming, and navigation and add short,
            direct instructions so learners are not guessing where to click or why.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Refine based on feedback and usage.</strong>
            I adjust based on instructor input, learner questions, and analytics
            such as where people stall or send help requests.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="highlight-note">
          The result is not a flashy one-off.
          It is a repeatable pattern that instructors can reuse and adapt.
        </p>

    <!-- Concrete examples -->
    <section class="pillars" style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">
      <h2>What this looks like in practice</h2>
      <div class="pillar-grid">
        <article class="pillar">
          <h3>From long syllabus to scannable overview</h3>
          <p>
            I turn long syllabus documents into one clear course overview in the LMS
            with key dates, expectations, and links grouped logically.
            Learners know what this course is about and how to succeed.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="pillar">
          <h3>From cluttered LMS shell to model course</h3>
          <p>
            I reorganize folders, rename items, and group tasks into weekly or modular flows.
            The model course then becomes a template that other faculty can copy and adapt.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="pillar">
          <h3>From ad hoc activities to aligned tasks</h3>
          <p>
            I connect each activity to an outcome and trim anything that does not earn its place.
            This reduces busywork for learners and keeps assessment aligned with what matters.

    <!-- Call to action -->

      <div class="highlight-content">
        <h2>Start with one course as a pilot</h2>
        <p>
          The best way to see my approach is to start with one course, program shell,
          or training module that feels messy or high effort to support.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will map the current experience, propose a flow-optimized version,
          and build a concrete model that your team can react to and reuse.
